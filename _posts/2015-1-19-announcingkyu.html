<p>In response to overwhelming community support, I'm elated to announce development has begun on my first game, <b>Kyu</b>. Kyu is a competitive card game played on a 3x3 grid. The gameplay is heavily borrowed from Triple Triad, the card minigame from Final Fantasy VIII.</p>

<p>Since this project started through community support, I want its progress to be accountable to the community. Therefore I want to announce three special features of Kyu development:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="{{ site.url }}blog/tagged/kyu/" target="_blank">
		Ongoing development and design choices will be captured in a blog.
	</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/davismj/kyu" target="_blank">
		Source is publically available on GitHub.
	</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://gitter.im/davismj/kyu" target="_blank">
		A dedicated Gitter room has been created for the project.
	</a></li>
</ol>

<h1>Project Roadmap</h1>
<p>Kyu will have three discrete parts that will developed in three separate phases. The first part is a library, written in ECMAScript 6, that handles all of the gameplay. The next part is a sever application, built on nodejs/Express 4, which will handle accepting input, processing and storing the result of the input in a database, and passing back the result. The final part is a web-based application, based on HTML5, which will be made public for all to play.</p>

<p>These design choices are subject to change. The goal is to create a library robust enough to enable snappy, responsive gameplay on the client, but secure, unexploitable results on the backend.</p>

<p>I'm grateful to all for your support. I'm looking forward to building our first game together!</p>
