#What's so good about an alias?
Since I've been working for myself, I've found myself sending out small bug and feature reports more often lately. I tried appending a small message requesting a bitcoin donation to one of these emails, and the recipient in fact donated. I think I might be on to something!

#How to do it
In a perfect world, I would be able to create a special email account for sending out these bug reports that would have a tip message signature. After looking into various options available to me, I found that this functionality comes with Gmail out of the box! Here's what you do:

1. Open Gmail settings and navigate to the `Accounts and Import` tab.
2. Under the `Send Mail As` section, click `Add another email address you own`.
3. For `Email address`, enter [your gmail address]+[alias]@gmail.com, keep `Treat as an alias` checked, and click `Next Step Â»`.
4. Refresh the page. Then, open settings and navigate to the `General` tab.
5. Under the `Signature` section, select your new alias from the drop down. Enter your desired signature and click `Save Changes` at the bottom.

Now, when sending an email, select the alias in the from dropdown and your signature will automatically be appended. In fact, this alias is treated like a completely separate email account in Gmail, so anything you can do with a specific email account, you can do with the alias. This includes signatures, labels, and filtering.
