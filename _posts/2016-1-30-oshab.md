The OSHAB team and I have been working together to upgrade their disease monitoring system. Together, we were able to accomplish some enormous tasks. First, we performed a massive overhaul on the spatial database, reducing unneeded complexity, upgrading query performance, and adding valuable features without compromising any important data. Next, we built an Aurelia-powered responsive front-end, to make data-entry quick and intuitive. Finally, we configured the data to be read by the <a href="http://easyterritory.com/">EasyTerritory</a> mapping platform. Features include:

- Custom authentication engine
- Custom front-end and back-end data validation to minimize invalid data
- Spatially enabled data for geospatial analysis
- Responsive front-end for easy-to-use data entry, anywhere
