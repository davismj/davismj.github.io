As part of the team behind [MapDotNet](http://www.mapdotnet.com), a formidable ArcGIS competitor, I helped build and maintain the tremendously succesful [EasyTerritory](http://www.easyterritory.com) SaaS platform before branching off into my own company in 2016.

## What is EasyTerritory?

EasyTerritory is a mapping application for territory management and spatial business intelligence which seamlessly synchronizes to Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

## What does it do?

Features of EasyTerritory include:

- Builds territories from zip codes, counties, states and other political boundaries
- Provides business intelligence through spatial queries and updates
- Computes optimal sales routes in seconds
- Allows collaboration across desktop and mobile devices
- Optionally syncs data to CRM

## What technology was it built on?

EasyTerritory runs on a Microsoft server stack, including SQL Server, .NET, and WCF. The EasyTerritory client is built on Durandal in TypeScript.

## What as my role in the project?

As part of the EasyTerritory team my responsibilities included:

- Providing support for the rest of the team on best practices for Durandal, Knockout, Grunt and other tools
- Refactoring and rearchitecting certain portions of the client application
- Implementing both internal and customer requested features on both the client and the server
- Performing deployments, initial set up, and on-going maintenance for many customers

## Demo

Though there is no public facing version of the application, you can view a short demo video below. At the time of writing, the EasyTerritory team is setting interested customers up with free trial accounts.
