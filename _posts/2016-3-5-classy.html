<p>In 2015, as part of a job interview for the amazing team at <a href="//merrybiz.jp/">MerryBiz</a>, I put together a python script that uses a supervised learning algorithm to classify documents into one of several categories. Rather than writing a simple blog about the demo, I decided to wrap the application in a small website and put it out for the world to use.</p>

<p>Classy accepts zip files containing folders of text files, where each folder is a classification. Classy then gives you an endpoint where upload new files and let Classy classify them for you. The website itself is a small wrapper for a REST API, and so you can also integrate the Classy API into your existing web service.</p>

<p>Head over to <a href="https://stayclassy.io/">https://stayclassy.io/</a> and give it a try to today.</p>
