<span style="text-decoration: underline">Learning Aurelia</span> by Manuel Guilbault was published by Packt Publishing last month, and I had the privilege of serving as the technical reviewer for the book. In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Learning Aurelia</span>, Manuel walks you through building your very first Aurelia application. Though the book is very approachable for novices, Manuel includes a tremendous amount of high-quality content, covering even advanced Aurelia features in-depth. The book is available for purchase or via subscription through the [PacktPub website](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-aurelia).
