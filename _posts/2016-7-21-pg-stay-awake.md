How many 10 km eggs have you hatched? Found? None? Is your inventory full of 2 km eggs that take forever to hatch? The best trainers use this one simple trick to keep their eggs churning and the 10 km eggs coming.

# Do you Pokémon and drive?

When you're driving, you need to keep your eyes on the road; but, you and I both know that if your phone goes to sleep, you're missing out on valuable distance that could hatch your eggs faster. Today, I'm going to teach you how to enable a special developer option **on your Android phone** that prevents your phone from going to sleep on you while you're driving, so you can keep the kilometers coming while you keep your eyes on the road.

# Enable the developer options

The first step to this trick is to enable developer options. Here's how you do it:

1) Open up the settings app.

2) Tap the "About phone" option.

3) Furiously tap the "Build number" row 7 times.

4) Congratulations, you're now a developer!

# Enable the "Stay awake" feature

Now that you're a developer, you have access to slick features, one of which will help you stay safe on the road while you hatch your eggs. It's called "Stay awake", and it will prevent your phone from sleeping while plugged in. Here's how to do it:

1) Open up the settings app.

2) Tap the new "Developer options" option.

3) Turn the Developer options on.

4) Turn "Stay awake" on. 

# Notes

The "Stay awake" feature will still dim your screen very low, and may appear to be sleeping, especially in bright sunlight. Don't fret, your slow driving will still register distance on your eggs, so **keep your eyes on the road**.
