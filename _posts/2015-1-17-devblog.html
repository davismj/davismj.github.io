<p>I've put about three months work into places. The app has undergone a great number of architecture changes and redesigns along the way. I've learned a great deal. My one regret is that I haven't been documenting my findings, and so I've decided to start a blog.</p>

<p>There are many things I want to accomplish with this developer blog. First and foremost, I believe that maintaining a developer blog will force me to think deeper about most of the issues that I face, and serve as a sort of "rubber ducky" debugging scheme. I also want to have some documentation of my design choices, both to expose what is going on in my head (which I hope is good and will inspire confidence) and to refer back to in the future. Lastly, I want to share all of what I've learned as a way of giving to the community.</p>

<p>In addition to places--because its always a good idea to jump on something new when you're halfway done with what you're currently working on--a new, smaller app might be in the works in the next week. I'm looking forward to documenting my progress with that app as well.</p>
