As an accomplished front-end developer, I felt that it was my responsibility to build my own website. From design to deployment, every line of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on this site was written by hand from scratch.

# Fully responsive

This site uses three separate stylesheets to achieve a responsive design and maintainable styles. All common styles are contained in style.css, mobile-specific styles are contained in mobile.css, and desktop-specific styles are likewise in desktop.css. The browser then selects the proper stylesheets through media queries.

# Search Engine Optimized

Each page is tagged with metadata that enables me to keep my high quality content on top of search rankings. 

# Handwritten JavaScript Components

If you read my article [You might not need a dialog library](http://davismj.me/blog/easy-dialog/) you'll know that I prefer handwriting JavaScript when the coding time is short. That's why the modal and carrousel components are all written by hand. Open dev tools, read the code, and use it on your own site!
