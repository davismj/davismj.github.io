# Built with Jekyll

When I decided to start blogging, I felt that it was responsibility to put as much time and effort into it as I would for a client. I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a developer-friendly blogging platform and the platform underlying GitHub pages. Jekyll has support for a number of important features out of the box, including SCSS and RSS, and uses the extremely flexible [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) templating language from the team at Shopify. 

# Fully responsive

Fully responsive is often synonymous with CSS grids, but grid frameworks only determine how content reflows as screen sizes change. There's a better way to deliver a premium responsive experience. This site uses three separate stylesheets: All common styles are contained in style.css; mobile-specific styles are contained in mobile.css; desktop-specific styles are likewise in desktop.css. The correct stylesheet is loaded with [media breakpoints](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/). This means that both the mobile and desktop views were individually crafted for their target sizes, unlike with CSS grids.

# Search Engine Optimized, Social Media Friendly

A website is only valuable so long as it can be found. Every blog post is optimized for both [Facebook Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/opengraph) and [Twitter cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started) so that it can be shared effectively. [Jekyll Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) drives the page metadata and is carefully selected to rank on the first page of search results. 

# Handwritten JavaScript Components

If you've read my article [You might not need a dialog library](http://davismj.me/blog/easy-dialog/) you'll know that I prefer handwriting simple components. That's why the modal and carrousel components are all written by hand to be compact and buttery smooth.
